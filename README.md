📈 Project Title:
Predicting Stock Price Movement Based on Financial Ratios and Market Cap Dynamics

🧠 Project Goal:
Develop a predictive model to classify whether a stock’s price will increase, decrease, or remain stable in the next quarter, based on its current financial metrics and historical performance.

🔍 Key Features to Explore:
Market Capitalization

Price/Earnings Ratio

Price-to-Book Ratio

Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Sector Classification (optional categorical variable)

Previous Quarter’s Price Change (%)

You can also engineer features like:

Volatility Score: Rolling standard deviation of weekly prices

Momentum Indicators: Percentage change over time windows

Valuation Banding: Categorize P/E and P/B into tiers

📊 Modeling Techniques:
Use classification models such as:

Logistic Regression for interpretability

Random Forest for feature importance and robustness

XGBoost or CatBoost for powerful gradient boosting

Try Time Series Classification approaches if your dataset is longitudinal

✅ Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy

Precision/Recall

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Curve

You could even simulate an investment strategy using your predictions to estimate hypothetical gains/losses 📉📈.

🔧 Bonus Extensions:
Add sentiment analysis from financial news articles or earnings call transcripts.

Incorporate macroeconomic indicators like interest rates, inflation, or unemployment to see if they strengthen your model.

Build a Streamlit dashboard to visualize your predictions and feature impacts interactively.
